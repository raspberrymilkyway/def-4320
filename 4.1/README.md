KEY:
- 0 means the system was unaffected (or not very affected) by the quandry
- 1 means the system was (majorly or somewhat) affected by the quandry

My topic was Edward Snowden's release of classified documents back in 2013. There are a couple perspectives to look at this from - namely: 
- the perspective of the government (one of the "wronged" parties)
- regular citizens (i.e. those who are not a part of the NSA or CIA or other similar department; one of the wronged parties)
- from the perspective of the tech industry and of businesses
- and from the perspectives of other countries hearing about it.

Some of my checkmarks may seem counterintuitive. Take the first one, for example - the government does not have a checkmark for spying on private citizens, since we're rating whether or not a system was affected by an ethical quandry. The government hasn't really changed their practices, so it was left unchecked. The NSA column was mostly determined by whether or not the NSA actually changed anything in response - they altered the way their database worked after Snowden released the data, to prevent a second occurrence. The topic of the 9th row ("Ordering a company...") is listed because Verizon (specifically mentioned in an article I read from The Guardian, where two of the original journalists involved worked) explicitly mentions in their Privacy Policy that they tell people when their information is being used or tracked; the government ordered them to not tell people, and while that doesn't break their Policy, it does lower their credibility. The "Foreign Relations" column is a mixed bag; foreign governments could be horrified at the amount of data collection the U.S. has while continuing to run their own operations. Some of them may have changed policies when they found out what had happened, but some may have become more worried. The last row ("Interpreting laws...") is mentioned because the NSA violated the privacy of innocent folks in the eyes of the public, but in their eyes it was justifiable within the bounds of the law and the spirit of keeping the country safe.

Some notes and thoughts I had while reading about this
- Other spy agencies were outed as a result, including the UK spy agency GCHQ. 
- Germany called the ordeal "reminiscent of the actions of enemies during the cold war". 
- Some of this reminds me of the speculation about Stuxnet (against the Iranian and Iraqian nuclear programs), but that has technically not been confirmed to have had U.S. participation. 
- I wonder if the U.S. government has been using Pegasus - it would easily allow them to gather data, for a presumably hefty price - or if they have some other form of spyware involving zero days. I wonder if we'll ever really know for sure.
